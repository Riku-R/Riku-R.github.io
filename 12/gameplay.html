                    The basics <br><br>
                    As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective.<br> 
                    Ten players each control one of the game's 122 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having their own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, known as the core and support.<br>
                    Cores, which are also called carries, begin each match as weak and vulnerable, but are able to become more powerful later in the game, thus becoming able to "carry" their team to victory.<br> 
                    Supports generally lack abilities that deal heavy damage, instead having ones with more functionality and utility that provide assistance for their cores, such as providing healing and other buffs.

                    The map <br><br>
                    The two teams—known as the Radiant and Dire—occupy fortified bases in opposite corners of the map, which is divided in half by a crossable river and connected by three paths, which are referred to as "lanes". The lanes are guarded by defensive towers that attack any opposing unit who gets within its line of sight.<br> 
                    A small group of weak computer-controlled creatures called "creeps" travel predefined paths along the lanes and attempt to attack any opposing heroes, creeps, and buildings in their way.<br>
                    Also present on the map are "neutral creeps" that are hostile to both teams, and reside in marked locations on the map known as "camps". Camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the "jungle", which both sides of the map have.

                    Why is DOTA 2 so addictive? <br><br>
                    Whether you’ve already tried DOTA 2 or not, you should be well aware that the game is not really a piece of cake. In fact, it may seem extremely difficult for new players to adjust to the mechanics of the game.<br>
                    The game doesn’t only have a large pool of heroes, each with its own level of difficulty, but it also takes a great amount of time to learn the map. <br>
                    There are also certain positions each member of the team has to take, and learning the responsibilities of all of them will be a time-consuming task.<br>
                    DOTA 2 can be very addictive, and it’s difficult to not jump into the next match right after the previous one. Just like binge watching a TV-series.
