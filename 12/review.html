                    My review of the game <br><br>
                    Having played DOTA 2 for thousands of hours and watched and studied it for many more thousands of hours, I think DOTA 2 is one of the best games that I have come across ever.
                    A wise man once told me, "DOTA 2 is, at the same time, the best and worst game of all time." There will certainly be moments where everyone, who has ever played DOTA 2 will most likely agree.<br><br>
                    DOTA 2 at it's core is a very balanced and routinely maintained game with A LOT to offer. Getting better at the game and noticing your progress while winning tough games against other skilled players is a very rewarding and euphoric experience. 
                    There is no perfect player or strategy for the game because there is always room for improvement, and that is what drives most players forward.<br><br>
                    The problem with having a very addictive game, where losses can be solely attributed to other teammates, is that players very easily start blaming their teammates for not doing their "job" properly. This can create a very hostile and negative atmosphere and bring down the whole team's morale.

                    My rating for DOTA 2 is a perfect 10/10. It is extremely difficult to get into, but once you do, you get to enjoy one of the best games ever made!
