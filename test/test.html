    <h1 class="otsikko">DOTA</h1>
    <div class="tekstidiv1">
    <p class="teksti1">Dota 2 is an online multiplayer game where you and four teammates choose from a roster of different heroes and, over the course of each match, gradually grow in strength and power until you’re strong enough to take down the enemy team’s Ancient – the glowing building in their home base.
        Of course, the opposing team has their eye on your Ancient, too, and wants to smash it to smithereens. So the whole match is a strategic balancing act, as you decide what you need to do to gain advantage for your team, while also making sure the enemy doesn’t snowball out of control.

        Many millions of hours of brainpower have gone into figuring out the optimal ways to do this, so there’s plenty to study – but, crucially, none of your teammates or enemies know how to play optimally, so really, it’s all about punishing your enemies’ mistakes while trying not to make too many of your own.
